# bitcoinPrices

The aim of this code is to take the price of bitcoin today and compare it with yesterdays prices.

The code uses the bitcoin api to work through the prices of bitcoin.

This will then be packaged and deployed to AWS as a lambda function which will then alert if the goes up or down.
